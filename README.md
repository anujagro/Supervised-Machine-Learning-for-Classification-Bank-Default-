# Supervised-Machine-Learning-for-Classification-Bank-Default-
Using UCI Bank Default Dataset for building and testing Supervised ML Models:

Models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Knn, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Other Concepts: Pipelines, Scikit-plot, GridSearch, Cross-Validation, 
Confusion Matrix, ROC, AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Threshold vs Recall/Precision, Custom Cost Function

--- Using all this i have tried to logically find the best model and score the test data using it.
